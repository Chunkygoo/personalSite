# Intro

I am an eager-to-learn software engineer working at Meta where I aspire to build interesting and useful things for people to use. I graduated from Colorado State University with a
double major in computer engineering and computer science back in May 2022. My interests lie mainly in deep learning and software engineering. I enjoy playing table tennis and coffee
a lot. I also like to watch movies as well as play card games like poker with my friends.

# A few words on my tech side

Some coursework that I have found interesting include:

- Assembly
- Computer Architecture and Organization
- Machine Learning
- Software Engineering
- C++ development
- Digital Circuit and Logic (Electronics)
- Operating System

Having had multiple technical internships, part-time jobs and freelance jobs, I have familiarized myself with a variety of technologies, including:

- Backend: Nodejs, Laravel (php), FastAPI
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, TailwindCSS
- Database: SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- AI/ML/DL: Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras, Matlab/Octave
- Others: Firebase, AWS, Numpy, Pandas, Arduino, RaspberryPi, Data Structures and Algorithms

Some interesting projects that I have worked on include:

- Automating a bookkeeping process (Python/Selenium).
- Creating an admin panel (Laravel/MySQL/React).
- A website to initialize a Java Project (Python/Django/Jinja/React).
- Created an Android-controlled toy car using a Bluetooth module and an Arduino.
- Create a neural network architecture to detect anomalies in Controller Area Network buses of automobiles.

# A few more words on my soft skills

Through internships and work experience, I learned to work effectively in a team and independently. I also understand the importance of customer obsession, that is to pay attention to customers, earn their trust and to deliver a product that satisfies their needs.

Moreover, working as a tutor and as a resident assistant have improved my facilitating and cooperative skill sets. The experience also further enhanced my leadership skills, inclusion awareness and community bonding abilities.

On the fun side, I have been playing table tennis competitively since 9 years old. This has had a significant impact in my life as I learned a lot about responsibility, discipline, leadership and how to be an effective team player. This led to the decision of founding the table tennis club at Colorado State University.

# Currently

I am wrapping up my two majors in computer engineering and computer science. I will be graduating in May 2022. I am honored to have been recognized by CSU as an outstanding grad:
